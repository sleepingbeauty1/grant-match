# Ad Campaign Operations - What We're Measuring

## Launch: Feb 19, 2026

### Daily Checklist (7 PM IST)
- [ ] Check ad performance (CTR, CPC, impressions)
- [ ] Check form submissions count
- [ ] Note key metrics in spreadsheet
- [ ] Flag any issues (low CTR, high CPC, etc.)

### Weekly Analysis (Feb 25)

#### Critical Question: Is There Real Demand?
Count founders who said "Yes, I need help applying"
- If >30% → Strong demand signal
- If 10-30% → Moderate demand
- If <10% → Weak demand

#### By Segment
- Which sector has highest "needs help" rate?
- Which stage has highest intent?
- Which state has best conversion?

#### Grant Patterns
- Which grants got clicked most?
- Which grants got marked "interested"?
- Are patterns by sector or universal?

### The Decision Point (Feb 26)

**If "needs help" >30%:**
- Real demand exists
- Build application guides immediately
- Email all users: "Help applying? Upgrade to pro ₹5000/month"
- Start with top 5 most-clicked grants

**If "needs help" 10-30%:**
- Demand exists but need to improve positioning
- Could pivot messaging: focus more on missing money angle
- Try another week of ads with revised creative

**If "needs help" <10%:**
- Idea might be dead or wrong market angle
- Consider pivoting to different problem

## Quick Decisions

**If CTR <2%:** Ad creative isn't resonating. Pause and iterate.
**If CPC >₹100:** Audience too broad or creative weak. Pause and iterate.
**If submissions <100 by day 3:** Campaign trajectory is bad. Kill and restart.

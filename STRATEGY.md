# Government Grants Discovery Platform - Research & Strategy

## Project Overview
**Problem:** Indian startup founders waste 100+ hours searching fragmented government grant programs, missing many relevant opportunities

**Solution:** AI-powered platform that matches startups with hyper-specific government grants and incentives based on their profile

**Customer:** Indian startup founders and accelerators
**Timeline:** MVP in 2 weeks, first customers in 3 weeks

## Phase 1: Market Research (This Week)

### 1. Government Grants Ecosystem Mapping
- [ ] Map major central schemes (DSIR, DPIIT, StartupIndia, NASSCOM, SIDBI)
- [ ] Map state-level programs (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bangalore Tech Parks)
- [ ] Identify 200+ active grant programs
- [ ] Categorize by: sector, stage, location, ticket size, application deadline

### 2. Founder Pain Points
- [ ] Survey 20+ startup founders on grant discovery process
- [ ] Identify: time spent, programs they missed, biggest blockers
- [ ] Understand: how do they currently find grants? What do they trust?

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- [ ] Pre-seed founders (need small grants $10-50K)
- [ ] Seed/Series A (need larger grants $100K+)
- [ ] Deep tech/biotech (sector-specific programs)
- [ ] Location-specific (tier 1 vs tier 2 vs tier 3 cities)

### 4. Competitor Analysis
- [ ] Who else is solving this? (GrantforAll, iednew.org, etc.)
- [ ] What's missing? What's broken?
- [ ] Opportunity gap?

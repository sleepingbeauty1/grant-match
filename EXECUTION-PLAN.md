# Government Grants Discovery - Execution Plan

## Feb 18, 2026 - Go Decision

**Status:** GREEN LIGHT - Full execution mode

---

## Phase 1: Ad Validation (This Week - Feb 18-24)

### What We're Testing
- Does the problem actually exist? (clicks)
- **IS THERE REAL DEMAND?** (who asks for help applying after seeing results)
- Which founder segments have highest intent? (sector/stage/location)
- Which grants get marked as interested? (click patterns)

### The Real Signal (Om's Insight)
- If founders DON'T ask for help applying → demand is fake
- If founders DO ask → we have a real business
- This is the make-or-break metric

### The Ad Campaign

**Creative:**
"Indian startup? Wasting 20+ hours hunting for grants? We found all 200+ government programs. See which ones you actually qualify for in 5 minutes."

**Targeting:**
- Indian startup founders
- Tech communities
- LinkedIn (if budget allows)
- Ages 25-50
- Interest: startups, entrepreneurship, business

**Budget:** $500-1000 (1 week run)

**Landing Page Flow:**
1. Value prop (headline repeats ad promise)
2. Quick questionnaire (90 seconds):
   - What sector? (dropdown)
   - What stage? (pre-seed/seed/series A)
   - What state? (dropdown)
   - Email for results
3. Immediate results:
   - Top 5 matching grants
   - Link to each grant
   - "Mark as interested" button
4. Data collected → CRM for follow-up

### Success Metrics
- 500-1000 questionnaire completions
- Cost per lead: $1-2
- Click-through rate: 3%+
- Email capture rate: 80%+
- Which sectors show up most
- Which grants get clicked (tells us what founders actually want)

### What We Learn
- Real demand signal (or dead idea)
- Founder segments (sector/stage/location)
- Grant priorities (which programs matter)
- Willingness to engage (email capture = signal)

---

## Phase 2: Add "Help Applying" Layer (Based on Ad Data - Feb 24-28)

### What We Build (If demand signal is strong)
- Application guides (step-by-step for top 5 grants)
- Document templates (required forms + checklist)
- Progress tracking (which stage of application they're at)
- Direct support (Slack/WhatsApp for questions)

### This is the Revenue Driver
- Free tier: Just matching
- Pro tier: ₹5000/month → application help + deadline tracking + support

### Why This Works
- Founders see grants they qualify for (free)
- Some apply themselves (good, low-touch)
- Some ask for help (high-intent, willing to pay)
- We help them apply (build relationship, prove value)
- They upgrade to pro or pay per-application

### The Messaging Shift
- OLD: "Find grants easily"
- NEW: "You qualify for ₹X lakh. We'll help you apply."

---

## Phase 3: Launch & Iterate (Mar 3+)

### If Ad Data Shows Strong Demand
- Launch pro tier at ₹5000/month (help applying feature)
- Email all free users: "Need help applying? Upgrade to pro"
- Start with founders who asked for help → prime conversion targets
- Build more application guides based on which grants get asked about most

### Monetization Strategy (Om's Key Insight)
- Discovery alone = "nice to have" = low conversion
- Help applying = real demand = customers will pay
- Position as: "Apply to ₹X grants in 2 weeks with our support"

### Revenue Timeline
- Month 1: 100 free users (from ads)
- Month 2: 10-20 paying customers from free tier
- Month 3: 30-50 paying customers (organic + word of mouth)
- Target: ₹5-10L MRR by end of Q1

---

## Phase 4: Customer Acquisition (Mar 3-7)

### Warm Leads from Ads
- Email the 500-1000 people who filled questionnaire
- "Hey, we built this. Want early access?"
- Offer: Free for first 100 users, then $99/month
- CTA: Sign up for beta

### Accelerators (Direct Outreach)
- List of top Indian accelerators
- Cold email: "We help your portfolio founders save 20+ hours on grants"
- Ask: Can we give free access to your founders?
- Value: You look good to your portfolio

### Founder Communities
- Twitter/LinkedIn posts
- WhatsApp groups (if allowed)
- Reddit (r/indianstartups, etc.)

### Target: 20-30 Paid Customers by Mar 10

---

## Phase 5: Scale (Mar 7+)

### Once we have 20-30 paying customers:
- Run more paid ads
- Expand to more states/sectors
- Build integrations (apply directly from platform)
- Hire support

---

## Key Decision (Om's Insight)

**Discovery alone won't drive revenue.**

The real business is:
1. Show founders which grants they qualify for (free)
2. Help them actually apply (paid)
3. Track their progress (paid)
4. Answer questions (paid)

Messaging must be: **"You qualify for ₹X. We'll help you apply and close the deal."**

Not: "Find all government grants."

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Ads FIRST, not research surveys**
   - Real money on real behavior > hypothetical surveys
   
2. **Database built AFTER ads**
   - Prioritize what founders actually want, not what we think they want
   
3. **MVP built AFTER database**
   - No guessing features, only what ads + data told us
   
4. **Customers BEFORE scaling**
   - Prove it works with 20-30 paying customers first

---

## Non-Negotiables

- Database accuracy > speed (if we get grant info wrong, we're done)
- Customer validation > feature completeness (20 paying customers > 100 free users)
- Actual revenue > vanity metrics (MRR matters, MAU doesn't)
- Execution > perfection (ship ads this week, iterate based on data)

# Government Grants Discovery - Execution Plan

## Feb 18, 2026 - Go Decision

**Status:** GREEN LIGHT - Full execution mode

---

## Phase 1: Ad Validation (This Week - Feb 18-24)

### What We're Testing
- Does the problem actually exist? (clicks)
- Will founders pay? (questionnaire intent signals)
- Which founders care most? (sector/stage/location distribution)
- Which grants matter most? (click patterns)

### The Ad Campaign

**Creative:**
"Indian startup? Wasting 20+ hours hunting for grants? We found all 200+ government programs. See which ones you actually qualify for in 5 minutes."

**Targeting:**
- Indian startup founders
- Tech communities
- LinkedIn (if budget allows)
- Ages 25-50
- Interest: startups, entrepreneurship, business

**Budget:** $500-1000 (1 week run)

**Landing Page Flow:**
1. Value prop (headline repeats ad promise)
2. Quick questionnaire (90 seconds):
   - What sector? (dropdown)
   - What stage? (pre-seed/seed/series A)
   - What state? (dropdown)
   - Email for results
3. Immediate results:
   - Top 5 matching grants
   - Link to each grant
   - "Mark as interested" button
4. Data collected → CRM for follow-up

### Success Metrics
- 500-1000 questionnaire completions
- Cost per lead: $1-2
- Click-through rate: 3%+
- Email capture rate: 80%+
- Which sectors show up most
- Which grants get clicked (tells us what founders actually want)

### What We Learn
- Real demand signal (or dead idea)
- Founder segments (sector/stage/location)
- Grant priorities (which programs matter)
- Willingness to engage (email capture = signal)

---

## Phase 2: Database Build (Based on Ad Learnings - Feb 24-28)

### After ads run, we know:
- Which sectors are interested
- Which stages are interested
- Which grants got clicked most
- Geographic distribution

### Then we build the database prioritizing:
1. Top 5 grants that got clicked (get these 100% accurate)
2. All grants for top sectors (40-50 programs)
3. All grants for top stage (20-30 programs)
4. All grants for top states (50+ programs)

### Database Fields (Per Grant)
- Name
- Sector applicability
- Stage requirements
- Ticket size
- Location requirements
- Eligibility criteria (detailed)
- Application deadline
- Application process
- Contact info
- Link

### Why This Order
- Start with what we know founders want (from ads)
- Get those right first (accuracy > comprehensiveness)
- Then expand to full database
- Avoid building for hypothetical founders

## Phase 3: MVP Build (Feb 28 - Mar 3)

### MVP Features (Based on Ad Data)
- Questionnaire (same as ad landing page)
- Matching engine (rule-based)
- Results dashboard
- "Export as PDF" for applications
- Email reminders for deadlines

### NOT in MVP
- ML matching (too early)
- Video tutorials (too early)
- Mentor intros (too early)
- Application tracking (too early)

### Why This Scope
- We only know what founders asked for from ads
- Build exactly that, nothing more
- Prove it works with paying customers first

---

## Phase 4: Customer Acquisition (Mar 3-7)

### Warm Leads from Ads
- Email the 500-1000 people who filled questionnaire
- "Hey, we built this. Want early access?"
- Offer: Free for first 100 users, then $99/month
- CTA: Sign up for beta

### Accelerators (Direct Outreach)
- List of top Indian accelerators
- Cold email: "We help your portfolio founders save 20+ hours on grants"
- Ask: Can we give free access to your founders?
- Value: You look good to your portfolio

### Founder Communities
- Twitter/LinkedIn posts
- WhatsApp groups (if allowed)
- Reddit (r/indianstartups, etc.)

### Target: 20-30 Paid Customers by Mar 10

---

## Phase 5: Scale (Mar 7+)

### Once we have 20-30 paying customers:
- Run more paid ads
- Expand to more states/sectors
- Build integrations (apply directly from platform)
- Hire support

---

## Constraints & Solutions

**Constraint: Can't call founders**
- Solution: Ads reach them directly, email for follow-up

**Constraint: Don't know what they want**
- Solution: Ad data + questionnaire tells us exactly

**Constraint: Accuracy matters**
- Solution: Start with top grants, get those perfect first

**Constraint: Competition?**
- Solution: Moat is accuracy + local expertise. Most won't do tedious work.

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Ads FIRST, not research surveys**
   - Real money on real behavior > hypothetical surveys
   
2. **Database built AFTER ads**
   - Prioritize what founders actually want, not what we think they want
   
3. **MVP built AFTER database**
   - No guessing features, only what ads + data told us
   
4. **Customers BEFORE scaling**
   - Prove it works with 20-30 paying customers first

---

## Non-Negotiables

- Database accuracy > speed (if we get grant info wrong, we're done)
- Customer validation > feature completeness (20 paying customers > 100 free users)
- Actual revenue > vanity metrics (MRR matters, MAU doesn't)
- Execution > perfection (ship ads this week, iterate based on data)
